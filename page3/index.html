            <h2>Michael De Santa</h2>
            <p>Michael de Santa, born Michael Townley, is a semi-retired bank robber who is forced back into a life of crime at the start of the game. He may be the introductory character, but the jury is still out on whether he edges out the other two playable characters in a popularity contest. Maybe he's just bland enough to get the most votes. </p>
